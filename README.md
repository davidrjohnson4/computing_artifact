This is a python implementation of geometric scattering for the IMDB-Binary graph dataset, based on:

Feng Gao, Guy Wolf, Matthew Hirn (2019). Geometric Scattering for Graph Data Analysis. <br>
Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 97:2122-2131. <br>
arXiv:1810.03068

To use, you can (interactively) run the cells in `run_on_IMDB-B.ipynb` notebook, which utilize the functions written into the other files.
